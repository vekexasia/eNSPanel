# PCB

The PCB can be ordered at any pcb manifacturing website that supports the Gerber format. The Gerber files are in the `gerber` folder.
Since v2.1 the PCB is <100x100mm this will allow for a big discount when ordering.

## How to order?

Simply download the `gerber.zip` file from the `gerber` folder and upload it to your favorite PCB manifacturer.

Another possibility would be using this [PCBWay shared project](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/eNSPanel_v2_1_4_f0fd8d8d.html). Be aware that the assembly and BOM in the project page has never been tested.
