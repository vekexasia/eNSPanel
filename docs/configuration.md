ESPHome configuration can be found in the `esphome` folder inside the repository. 

Also minimal configuration for specific modules can be found in the respective module pages. For example, the [microphone](modules/microphone.md) and the [presence sensor](modules/presence.md) have their own configuration snippets.

## vekexasia-hmi.yaml

You can check the `vekexasia-hmi.yaml` file for a way to use the other modules yaml files.

Keep in mind that the `vekexasia-hmi.yaml` file is a way to combine all the modules into one yaml file. It is not a requirement to use it.

Also, this configuration might not work out of the box as it might be missing some other configuration elements that I regularly use.
