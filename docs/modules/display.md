The capacitive Nextion display is what makes the NSPanel a good Home automation product.

## GPIO

In the original board the nextion display communicates with the esp32 via `IO16` & `IO17`. In the new board the display communicates with the esp32 via `IO5` & `IO6`, they are not hardware UART but that was already allocated to the presence sensor which has a higher baudrate.

## Configuration

Always refer to the `esphome` folder for the most up to date working configuration. This is a known to be working minimal configuration for the display

```yaml

uart:
  - tx_pin: 5
    rx_pin: 6
    baud_rate: 115200
    rx_buffer_size: 4096
    id: tf_uart

display:
  - platform: nextion
    id: disp1
    uart_id: tf_uart
    tft_url: $tft_url

switch:
  - platform: gpio
    name: Screen Power
    id: screen_power
    entity_category: config
    pin:
      number: 4
      inverted: true
    restore_mode: ALWAYS_OFF
```

Please note that the `tft_url` should be the path to the compiled tft file. The `tft` file is the compiled version of the `HMI` file that is generated by the Nextion Editor.

Also note that there are other configuration elements that make the display work as expected. Please refer to the `esphome` folder for the most up to date configuration.

## Part

There are several parts that are required for the display to work. The parts are all contained in the `DISPLAY` silkscreen polygon.
